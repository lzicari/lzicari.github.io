As a Columbia MPH candidate specializing in Advanced Epidemiology, I have a strong foundation in quantitative methods and public health research. I've demonstrated these skills through various positions but my most recent experience includes working at the NYC Department of Mental Health & Hygiene as a Data Analyst in Emergency Preparedness. I am also a Teaching Assistant for a Master level course in Research Methods and Applications at Columbia University. I am seeking opportunities in Biotech, Health Outcomes and Economics, or Healthcare Consulting where I can apply these skills to initiatives that improve health outcomes on a broad scale. I am especially interested in roles that translate epidemiological insights into practical applications for policy, technology, and healthcare delivery.
